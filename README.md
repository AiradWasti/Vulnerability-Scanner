<h1>Vulnerability Scanner</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script is a multi-threaded vulnerability scanner that prompts the user to input an IP address and checks specified ports (21, 22, 25, 80, 110, 443, 445) for open services. It attempts to retrieve service banners from these ports and checks them against known vulnerability signatures listed in a provided file. The script uses threading to scan multiple ports concurrently, improving efficiency, and logs the results and errors for better traceability. If any banners match the known vulnerabilities, it warns the user. This tool is useful for network administrators and security professionals to quickly identify potential vulnerabilities on a given host.
